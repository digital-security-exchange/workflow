# Initial Consult & Assessment

The goal of the initial consult is to gather additional information about an organization's current security practices, the tools they use, their makeup and demographics, organizational goals, desired timeframe for assistance and other concerns. The goal of the initial consult is to better determine an organization's case needs, in an effort to better match them with a provider.
