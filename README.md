# The DSX

## **Who we are**

### _The DSX helps nonprofit organizations discover their digital security needs and build sustainable strategies to address critical gaps._

#### 

#### We do this by:

#### Working with organizations to understand their unique challenges, needs, and protocols for staying safe online 

#### Discovering gaps, missing processes, or fundamental security threats  

#### Partnering organizations with trusted digital security providers who can further asses their needs and implement long-term security strategies  

#### Connecting them to the DSX Link helpdesk and larger community of DSX members for incident response, knowledge sharing, and ongoing assistance

## Overview of our process:

1. We are a community of member U.S. organizations and digital security providers. 

2. When organizations request help we provide an initial assessment of their needs to determine what is needed to bring them up to a baseline of digital security.

3. We then match the organization to one of our trusted digital security providers who will implement their plan and conduct staff trainings. 
4. After implementation and trainings, the DSX will onboard organizations to our DSX Link helpdesk for ongoing support and incident response. This also provides access to the larger DSX member communities and network of providers.
