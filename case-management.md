# Case Management

## To do:

* [Case status tracking within Zammad](zammad-setup-organization-onboard/case-tracking.md)

  * Update cases within Zammad to be relevant 
  * Ensure things are moving forward
  * Checkin with 'match' to help ensure a good and productive experience 

  Case monitoring within/outside Zammad \(link here to questions or survey\)

  * How's it going? Have everything you need? Is there anyone else you need to be connected to?
    * Checkin with Organization \(how often, in what way?\)
    * Checkin with Provider \(how often, in what way?\)
