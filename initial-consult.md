# Initial Consult

Initial consult is done between an Organization's contact and a DSX team member. The goal of the initial consult is to gather additional information about an organization's current security practices, the tools they use, their makeup and demographics, organizational goals, desired timeframe for assistance and other concerns. The goal of the initial consult is to better determine an organization's case needs, to better match them with a provider.
